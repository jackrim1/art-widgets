##ArtWidgets

This is intended to be an opensource base for artists who need to do stuff with images. Watch this space

###Some ideas for first widgets
- Addind grids to images, with lots of fine grain controls
- Working out ratios of images, and which is the most suitable common canvas size for that ratio
- Colour pickers
- Generating blurred or simplified versions of images
- Integrations with generative AI apis to work with images

###Some paid for features further down the road
- Storage of images
- Gallery/showcase
- Chrome extension to grab and save images
